#**YouTube Music: Identifying Niche Content Gaps**

##**Project Overview**

This project addresses a critical business challenge for the YouTube Music Content Operations (MCO) team: proactively identifying and prioritizing missing content from niche genres and emerging artists. By analyzing simulated user listening and engagement data, this project develops a data-driven framework to uncover high-value content gaps that are often missed by traditional search-based algorithms. The goal is to create a scalable solution that helps the MCO team make strategic content acquisition decisions, reinforcing YouTube Music as a complete and comprehensive platform for all music fans.

###**Business Problem**
Current algorithmic methods for gap detection primarily rely on high-volume search queries, which often overlook artists and genres with smaller, but highly engaged, fan bases. This leaves significant content gaps for niche audiences, negatively impacting user experience and limiting the platform's ability to serve a diverse global audience. This project will provide a proof-of-concept for a proactive, data-driven approach to fill these specific gaps.

###**Project Methodology**

**This project follows a phased, agile approach:**

**Business Understanding:** Define the problem, scope, and KPIs.

**Data Acquisition & Preparation:** Simulate a data pipeline by ingesting, joining, and cleaning mock datasets in Google BigQuery and Python.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze user listening patterns to identify emerging communities and genres.

**Modeling & Analysis:** Develop a prioritization model to rank missing content based on its engagement potential and genre relevance.

**Reporting & Communication:** Visualize actionable insights in an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
